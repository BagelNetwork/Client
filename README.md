# Bagel Developer Documentation ðŸ¥¯

Welcome to the Bagel client hub. Here, the future of decentralized machine learning unfolds.

Our mission is to empower teams, regardless of their resources, to develop AI models and applications. We envision a landscape where every developer has the tools to challenge the dominance of established tech giants. Together, we are paving the way to democratize AI technology.

Bagel, akin to a peer-to-peer HuggingFace, serves as the foundational infrastructure for the emergence of Artificial General Intelligence from the open-source community.

We have developed two main clients to facilitate your projects: JavaScript and Python. Explore our litepaper for a comprehensive understanding of what Bagel offers.
