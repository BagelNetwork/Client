# BagelDB Developer Documentation ðŸ¥¯

Welcome to the BagelDB client repository! If you're here, you're probably eager to dive into the world of BagelDB. And, guess what? We've prepared two clients to make your journey smooth: one for JavaScript and another for Python.

## What's Inside? ðŸ¥¯

Well, this repository houses tools that make chatting with the BagelDB API a breeze. Instead of you juggling with HTTP requests or handling API responses, these clients will take on the grunt work. What's left for you? Just the fun part â€“ crafting great applications!

### Directory Breakdown ðŸ¥¯

- **[JavaScript Client](https://github.com/Bagel-DB/Client/tree/main/javascript)**: Tucked here is our JavaScript client, along with some nifty instructions, illustrative examples, and tests to ensure everything's running smoothly.
  
- **[Python Client](https://github.com/Bagel-DB/Client/tree/main/python)**: For our Python aficionados, this spot has everything you need: the client itself, guidance on its usage, some sample code, and, of course, tests.

## Ready to Roll? ðŸ¥¯

If you're itching to get started, just head to either the JavaScript or Python client directory. The READMEs there are pretty helpful, walking you through the setup step-by-step. And, oh, don't forget about dependencies and environment variables â€“ they're key!
