# Bagel Developer Documentation ðŸ¥¯

Welcome to the Bagel client hub! It's a thrill to see you stepping into the future with us.

Driven by purpose, our mission is to empower resource-limited teams, to craft state-of-the-art AI models and apps. We envision a world where, even without vast capital, teams can rival tech titans like Google and OpenAI. Together, let's democratize the AI frontier.

For a seamless experience, we've tailored two dedicated clients for you: JavaScript and Python. If you're eager to delve deeper into Bagel's capabilities, our litepaper awaits your perusal.


## What's Inside? ðŸ¥¯

Well, this repository houses tools that make chatting with the Bagel API a breeze. Instead of you juggling with HTTP requests or handling API responses, these clients will take on the grunt work. What's left for you? Just the fun part â€“ crafting great applications!
